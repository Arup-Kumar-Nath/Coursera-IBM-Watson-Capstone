# Coursera-IBM-Watson-Capstone
This is a capstone project of Coursera on IBM Watson Studio in which we have to apply our skills to use different Machine Learning algorithm to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, we had to complete a notebook where we build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.  We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. I used the following algorithms to build the models:  k-Nearest Neighbour Decision Tree Support Vector Machine Logistic Regression The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:  Jaccard index F1-score LogLoass
